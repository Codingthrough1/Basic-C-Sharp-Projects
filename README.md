# C# Course Projects

## Description
This repository contains projects completed during my C# course. These projects helped me practice object-oriented programming concepts, interfaces, polymorphism, and console application development.

## Key Skills Gained
- C# programming fundamentals  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Interfaces and polymorphism  
- Console application development  
- GitHub repository management

## Sample Project: EmployeeQuitApp
A console application demonstrating interfaces and polymorphism. The `Employee` class implements `IQuittable`, allowing employees to "quit" via a common interface method.

**Example Output:**
John Doe has quit the job.
